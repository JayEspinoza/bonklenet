# bonklenet
An image classification network for Kanohi masks

Bonklenet is an image classification model designed to identify Kanohi Masks from the LEGO Bionicle toyline.

The network will be trained off of the Nui Rama Image Dataset, the initial version of which will only include the masks from the 2001 series of Bionicle figures. 
This dataset covers a total of 12 masks over 88 images. The plan is to expand the dataset over time and update the model accordingly.

Currently, Bonklenet can identify the Miru, Kaukau, Huna, Pakari, Mahiki, Rau, Hau, Ruru, Komau, Matatu, Akaku, and Kakama masks with about 90% accuracy.

I started this project as a way to better understand and learn CNNs. This repo will serve as documentation of this journey.

All images belong to their respective holders. This project purely serves in an educational capacity.
